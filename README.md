# DrawTheNet.IO : Diagrams as code for engineers.

![Logo](docs/logo.png)

DrawTheNet.IO draws network diagrams dynamically from a text file describing the placement, layout and icons.

## See in live :  https://drawthenet.io

Given a yaml file describing the hierarchy of the network and it's connections, a resulting diagram will be created.

# Motivation

Complex network diagrams typically involve specific placement of icons, connections and labels using a tool like Visio or OmniGraffle, using a mouse, and constantly zooming in and out for single pixel placement. 

The goal behind drawthenet.io is to be able to describe the diagram in a text file and have it rendered in SVG in the browser.

Also, being able to store a diagram as text makes it easy to version control and share.

# Quick start

Go to https://drawthenet.io and start creating diagrams.

Tha app was designed to be used in a browser and does not require any installation. No diagram are stored anywhere but locally to your PC.

# Build Instruction
## Docker Build (Prefered)

You can easily build the tool to host locally with the provided [docker file](./tools/Dockerfile):

```
cd ./tools/
docker build -t local/drawthenet.io .
```

It will build the docker image from scratch, including downloading the icons from all vendor specified above. It will run the app with nginx, listening on port 80.

## Local Build
You need [libvisio2svg](https://github.com/kakwa/libvisio2svg) includning its dependencies (libxml2-dev libwmf-dev gsfonts libemf2svg-dev libvisio-dev librevenge-dev) and powershell installed and available in you path for the full build to work.
If not, some icons set (Cisco, Fortinet) will not be generated and available.
You can find the build script in the [tools folder](./tools/build.ps1)

```
cd ./tools/
pwsh ./build.ps1
```

Additional arguments can be passed to the script to only run parts of the build process, refer to the script for more information.

The result will be created in the ./dist/ folder.

As it is a fully static website, you can host it on any webserver.
